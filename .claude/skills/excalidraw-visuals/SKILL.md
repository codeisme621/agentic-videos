# Excalidraw Visual Generation

Create professional hand-drawn style visuals by generating `.excalidraw` JSON files programmatically, then validating them visually in the browser.

## Guidelines of Phased based approach for creating Excalidraw json files


### Phase 1: Analyze Script for Visual Segments

Read the script and identify moments that benefit from visuals:

| Script Pattern | Visual Type | JSON Approach |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| "Today we'll learn about X" | Concept introduction | Central rectangle with radiating elements |
| "First... then... finally" | Process/Flow | Connected rectangles with arrows |
| "X vs Y" or "compared to" | Comparison | Side-by-side rectangles |
| "There are 3 types..." | Categories | Grouped containers |
| "The architecture includes..." | System diagram | Boxes with connecting arrows |
| Statistics or percentages | Data visual | Large text with supporting shapes |


### Phase 2: Create Task Plan and intial empty Excalidraw json file.

**Initial Excalidraw JSON**: Create the intial Excalidraw json file in the output directory.  Give it a unqiue descriptive name with .excalidraw extension.  Format output/<Unique descriptive name>.excalidraw

**CRITICAL**: Before generating JSON, create a task plan to avoid hitting token limits. Large diagrams with many elements can exceed output limits if generated all at once.

**Why plan first?**
- Excalidraw JSON is verbose (each element requires 15+ fields)
- A diagram with 10+ elements can easily exceed token limits
- Breaking work into chunks ensures complete, valid output

**How to plan:**

1. Review the visual segments identified in Step 1
2. Create a TODO task for each logical chunk of work
3. Each task should represent a manageable piece of JSON generation

**Guidance for chunking (flexible, not rigid rules):**

| Approach | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| One task per visual segment | Default approach - each scene/moment gets its own task |
| One task per element group | When a single segment has many related elements (e.g., a flowchart with 8 boxes) |
| One task per element type | When building systematically (all rectangles, then all text, then all arrows) |

**Example task plan for a flowchart diagram:**

```
TODO 1: Create base file structure and canvas setup
TODO 2: Generate main process boxes (rectangles for steps 1-4)
TODO 3: Generate decision diamond and branch boxes
TODO 4: Generate text labels for all shapes
TODO 5: Generate arrow connectors between elements
TODO 6: Final assembly and validation
```

**Example task plan for a multi-scene video:**

```
TODO 1: Create base file structure
TODO 2: Scene 1 - Introduction concept diagram (central box + radiating elements)
TODO 3: Scene 2 - Comparison chart (side-by-side boxes)
TODO 4: Scene 3 - Process flow (connected rectangles)
TODO 5: Final validation and positioning adjustments
```

**Task creation tips:**
- Use the TaskCreate tool to track progress
- Each task should produce a defined set of elements
- Include element IDs in task descriptions for cross-referencing
- Mark tasks complete as you generate each chunk

---

### Phase 3: Generate Excalidraw JSON
In this phase you should be filling the output/<Unique descriptive name>.excalidraw with json from the task list identfied in Phase 2.

**CRITICAL**: Read [reference/Presenting_Information_Visually.pdf](reference/Presenting_Information_Visually.pdf) principles to understand design best practices

**CRITICAL**: Read [reference/excalidraw-json-schema.md](reference/excalidraw-json-schema.md) to understand the excalidraw json schema.

**CRITICAL**: Reuse Excalidraw library visuals whenever possible. You can reuse as is Or you can extend / modify the library visual.

### Using Library Components

1. Find the item name in the library catalog below
2. Extract using:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/extract_library_item.py libraries/<library>.excalidrawlib "<item_name>"
   ```
3. Modify x, y coordinates and generate new IDs for your layout

**Example:**
```bash
python3 scripts/extract_library_item.py libraries/aws-architecture-icons.excalidrawlib "S3"
```

**List all items in a library:**
```bash
python3 scripts/extract_library_item.py libraries/icons.excalidrawlib --list
```

### Phase 4: Validate JSON

Run the validation script before importing:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_excalidraw.py output/your_file.excalidraw
```

Fix any errors reported.
