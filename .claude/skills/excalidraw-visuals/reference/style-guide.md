# Visual Style Guide

Based on visual communication best practices for educational content.

## Core Principle: Simplicity

**Visuals are processed 60,000x faster than text.**

Keep diagrams scannable and focused. Don't try to show everything — show the key insight.

## The 4 Types of Visualizations

### 1. Icons
Simple visual cues that convey meaning quickly.
- Use for: Actions, concepts, categories
- Keep recognizable and universally understandable
- Examples: Save icon, lock icon, arrow

### 2. Data Visuals
Abstract representations of data.
- Use for: Statistics, comparisons, trends
- Bar charts, simple graphs, percentage callouts
- Make the key number prominent

### 3. Graphic Organizers
Structure and organize information.
- Use for: Processes, decisions, hierarchies
- Flowcharts, mind maps, tree structures
- Use shapes consistently (diamonds = decisions)

### 4. Infographics
Combine elements to tell a complete story.
- Use for: Complex topics, summaries
- Integrate icons, data, and text
- Guide the viewer's eye through the narrative

## Gestalt Principles

### Proximity
Items close together are perceived as related.
- Group related elements tightly
- Use space to separate distinct concepts

### Similarity
Similar items are perceived as related.
- Use consistent colors for related concepts
- Use consistent shapes for same-type elements

### Closure
Our brains complete incomplete shapes.
- Don't over-detail; viewers fill gaps
- Dashed lines suggest connection without solid commitment

### Continuity
The eye follows paths and lines.
- Use arrows to guide attention flow
- Align elements along invisible lines

## Color Psychology

### Warm Colors (Active/Positive)
| Color | Hex | Use For |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Light Pink | `#ffc9c9` | Warnings, important items |
| Light Yellow | `#ffec99` | Highlights, decisions |
| Light Orange | `#ffd8a8` | Energy, action items |

### Cool Colors (Passive/Neutral)
| Color | Hex | Use For |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Light Blue | `#a5d8ff` | Information, processes |
| Light Green | `#b2f2bb` | Success, completion |
| Light Purple | `#d0bfff` | Creative, special items |

### Neutral
| Color | Hex | Use For |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Near Black | `#1e1e1e` | Strokes, text |
| White | `#ffffff` | Background |

## DO and DON'T

### DO ✓
1. Use clear and concise labels
2. Use appropriate colors and size
3. Maintain consistency in visual elements
4. Focus on key information
5. Use visual hierarchy to prioritize content

### DON'T ✗
1. Over-complicate
2. Overwhelm with too many elements
3. Use excessive text
4. Use conflicting color schemes
5. Neglect accessibility considerations

## Typography Guidelines

### Size Hierarchy
- **Title/Header**: 36-48px
- **Section Label**: 24-28px
- **Body/Detail**: 16-20px
- **Annotation**: 12-14px (use sparingly)

### Font Style
- Use Excalidraw's default "Virgil" font for hand-drawn feel
- Use "Helvetica" for cleaner, more professional look
- Use "Cascadia" (monospace) for code/technical content

## Diagram-Specific Guidelines

### Flowcharts
```
Start/End    → Rounded rectangles (green)
Process      → Rectangles (blue)
Decision     → Diamonds (yellow/orange)
Arrows       → Connect with clear direction
```

### Comparison Charts
```
Side A       │ VS │      Side B
─────────────┼────┼─────────────
[Blue box]   │    │  [Green box]
```

### Concept Maps
```
              ┌─────────┐
         ┌────┤ CENTRAL ├────┐
         │    └─────────┘    │
    ┌────┴────┐         ┌────┴────┐
    │ Branch  │         │ Branch  │
    └─────────┘         └─────────┘
```

### Data Callouts
```
    ╔═══════════════╗
    ║     60%       ║  ← Big number, prominent
    ║  improvement  ║  ← Short label
    ╚═══════════════╝
```

## The Cone of Learning

Reference for why visuals matter:

| Activity | Retention |
|----------|-----------|
| What we HEAR | 10% |
| What we READ | 20% |
| What we SEE | 30% |
| What we SEE & HEAR | 50% |
| What we SAY | 70% |
| What we DO | 90% |

**Visual content falls in the 30-50% range** — significantly better than text alone.

## Canvas Composition

### YouTube-Optimized Dimensions
- **Canvas**: 1920 x 1080 (16:9)
- **Safe area**: Keep key content within 1720 x 880 center
- **Margins**: 100px from edges

### Visual Balance
- Don't center everything — offset creates interest
- Use the "rule of thirds" for focal points
- Leave breathing room (negative space)

### Reading Direction
- Western audiences: Left → Right, Top → Bottom
- Place starting points top-left
- End conclusion bottom-right
